## Quick Overview

This is a minimalistic starter app to benefit of the flexibility of Babel and of ES6, ES7+, if you you want to use the latest ECMAscript features (e.g. ES6 modules) without waiting for nodejs to support them natively, already configured with a custom .vscode to allow debugging inside Visual studio code IDE
